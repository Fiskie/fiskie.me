Found my old forum account. Back in my hotel room now.

The letters we were all handed are titled "notice of denial of future access to the national exhibition centre". On the other side is a map of the NEC and it feels like they got lazy and used scrap paper to make photocopies. This makes me think it could be a routine they do to scare people with a slap on the wrist. But on the other hand it's way too elaborate.

Another thing I remember the nice NEC staff member saying: apparently there was an incident the night before where someone went berserk and attacked two medics, said it might be why the guards are on edge.

It's incredibly late. When stuff like this happens I always tend to loop through what happened and think about what could have been done differently. I tend to worry a lot and this really ****s with me.

Going to try and sleep now and will see what happens when I pick my stuff up in the afternoon.

I want people to know about my experience. If you get harassed by these clowns, remember they aren't real cops, they can't touch you and you are free to leave the site because the extent of their authority is removing you for trespassing. That is something I forgot about
