Imprisonment is an injury, regardless of how you justify it.

*Multiplay Insomnia* is an event held a few times every year by Multiplay UK, a game server hosting company. Multiplay is jointly owned by GAME (yes, *that* video game retailer) and Unity (yes, *that* game engine SDK). This is a sizable LAN/exhibition event that takes place over a long weekend. Since 2016, the event has been hosted at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, England.

We've attended it for years without issue. That was until i61, when we had an unfortunate encounter. This is my account of the time me and my partner were harassed, assaulted and unlawfully detained by security staff at Multiplay Insomnia.

## Timeline of events

**August, 2017:** Before the incident occurred, it was obvious that the night-time security at Insomnia was far more aggressive than the day-time staff. Generally, understandably so, since there's a lot more weird people out at night. Security would flip between being too lax, to having multiple people scrupulously check your wristband as if it were a production line. It was a bit unnerving when needing to regularly go in and out to do anything, because you'd be unsure how they'd react that time around.

**21:50, Saturday:** Me and my partner, and our wider circle of friends, went to sit down in an open-air pavilion. There were benches in there; semi-circular ones where you could fit at least a dozen people. We wanted a bit of peace and quiet, and some fresh air. There were nine of us.

Some of our friends began passing around some badly-rolled marijuana joints. Four of us weren't interested; me and my partner just wanted to talk and observe, and we knew we weren't doing anything illegal by sitting. That was when two security guards came in and surrounded the exits. They radioed in four more.

Immediately, they asked us who had taken part -- we were all completely honest. This made me believe they would at least be reasonable. But then they kept us all there anyway, at which point things went horribly wrong.

Bref, Multiplay's security staff had:

* unlawfully detained us for *two hours*, from 10pm to midnight
* cut our wristbands, thereby severing our access to the event
* confiscated our lanyards, which resulted in complications later on
* claimed I was "under the influence of second-hand smoke" when I protested as to why I was still there
* tried to escalate the situation, yelling and claiming I called one of their staff members a "f\*\*\*ing wanker" (in hopes of starting a fight out of boredom?)
* repeatedly referred to each other as "officer" to exaggerate their actual level of authority
* continued to keep us unlawfully detained after making it clear the police were not getting involved 
* handed us all "denial of entrance" letters which were forced to sign one-by-one, under threat of "having to write a police statement"

Hindsight is a bitch. It was only until after the incident I find that what they did was illegal, and six months later I'm still kicking myself for not recording what had happened (plus, one of them was shouting at me to put my phone away). At the time, I did not know what they were able to do, and how much force they could have used. Legally, me and my partner could've left at any time.

Some higher-up Multiplay staff member was called over to where we were to approve of what was happening. It was almost out of earshot, but the conversation seemed to be about whether she wanted us to be banned from the event or not, to which she nodded and wandered off somewhere. She just wanted us cut loose. One of the guards came over and told us we had received lifetime bans from Insomnia events and the NEC.

It was like this was a scene that had been rehearsed before; the security staff definitely found enjoyment out of what they were doing. After giving a long lecture on how cannabis was bad, several of them laughed and went on a cigarette break under the closed canopy. I wish I was joking.

After enough time had passed, we were split up and escorted partway back to our hotels. If we had been using the indoor camping facility, they threatened to remove our access to that amenity on the same night, thus leave us two miles from the nearest town with nowhere to sleep but the rough. It is fortunate we weren't using it.

Our last escort was an actual, permanent NEC security staff member, who reassured us that the bans are meaningless and unenforceable, and to come back next year. 

**00:30, Sunday:** There was a rendezvous at our hotel, where all the exiled event goers and some unbanned friends ended up. We were in the restaurant area until the early hours of the morning. Everything was shit.

It was the night of the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight. While this was going on I was busy drafting my account of what happened and posting it to the Multiplay forums, a thread that ended up getting a lot of attention. Responses to the thread itself were divided between sympathies and comments with regard to guilt-by-association.

At this point I was still wondering whether what happened was real. Surely it was all just a bit of fun and our LAN access would be reinstated in the morning, right? They weren't really going to punish someone they already illegally held against their will, were they?

**07:00:** What happened was, frankly, unforgettable and neither me or my partner could sleep. From looking at the eyes of my friends, we weren't the only ones.

**12:00:** We had to, eventually, deal with the humiliation of going into the event hall and packing up my things under the supervision of a security guard. I think they tried their best to make it as not horrible as possible.

The difference between the night-time and the day-time staff is, well, night and day. The day-time staff seemed *very* sympathetic as to what was going on, although at the same time just shrugged and let what happened continue to happen.

Some popular LAN goers had caught wind of what happened and were very supportive. One offered to drag into protest an entire competitive scene, but that was a bit too much a gambit and the community didn't want to risk their reputation. I didn't ask for it, nor did I expect it to accomplish anything, but I appreciated his spirit.

After having to take everything down and out, the security guard escorting me told me all we'd need to do is write an email to some manager at the NEC with an apology to lift the ban. But therein lies another problem: what were we apologising for? Everyone was overlooking the mistakes that had been made.

The thread I posted on the Multiplay forums received more and more attention, before eventually getting locked for derailing into the ethics of recreational drug use.

**17:00:** Our non-banned friends who were left alone in the LAN halls came to join us out of the venue. Completely sleep deprived, we all went into Birmingham for a bit because we virtually had nothing else to do. The rest of that evening was actually pretty great, with regards to what happened the night before.

We had told the staff member taking care of the restaurant about had happened the night before, and I think he did his best to help us forget. He allowed us to spend the evening in the hotel restaurant watching gameplay clips and Netflix's *Death Note* on a TV hooked up to a laptop. The incident had brought us closer together.
 
But this isn't a story about friendship. An injustice had occurred, and someone needed to answer for it.

## Chain of command

Multiplay have tried to pass on the blame to the NEC, but I won't allow it. Hiring a venue means you hire the staff that come with it, and *you can tell them what to do*. This is pretty important, because they might need to know how your event works.

One of the dumbest things those goons did was take away the lanyards, because ~ surprise ~ they did not know what they were for. I left mine in my hotel room (or so I thought -- it was actually at my desk), so mine was not confiscated like the others. The lanyards have a printed password shared by stickers applied to your monitor and PC tower -- a form of authentication, so opportunists couldn't simply walk out of the event with your prized hardware. **The security staff had no clue what these lanyards were for**. But they took them anyway. This meant checking out took longer, as my friends had to prove ownership of their own hardware by setting their machines back up, turning it on and logging in in front of a staff member.

What did become clear was that the night-time staff were contracted and not in permanent positions like the rest of the NEC security detail. Thus, the night-time staff were poorly trained regardless of what little Multiplay told them about the event, and they really didn't care. They follow assignments and hope something fun will happen. The twenty-something secondary school dropout in the night detail was simply ecstatic to have an opportunity to swing a torch around and swear at people.

Even the day-time security staff have barely any idea what goes on at Insomnia. Anyone who has attended these events in the past might've overheard some of the staff try to guess as to why kids are bringing computers from home to sit around in a hall and play games. It's an entirely different world to them. When checking into the event, security personnel looked at my screwdriver and needed to ask another if tools were allowed.

Security is arbitrary all over. While I was escorted out, the day-time staff member admitted to me he would have never handled the incident like it had been. "It's just a spliff, it's not like you're *dealing*," he said, "I would have just told you to put it out." He was assuming I was guilty, said I looked the type. Well, thanks.

It really feels like the security staff have no idea what kind of person goes to these events. I don't give a damn about concerts, or clubs. I'm introverted as heck, and so are half of the people who go to these things. It was Multiplay's duty to inform *their* security staff of what should be expected, and how they should have responded.

With regards to actually organising their security, Multiplay had failed.

## Resentment

Multiplay's approach to this situation was clear: try to fish for an admission of guilt, then hope the problem goes away on its own. We had sent off a couple of emails. My partner received a reply from a Michael "GeoSnipe" Lambert, Multiplay's lead event manager.

The first point Michael made was that there is a zero-tolerance policy on drugs: "if you are caught to be *using or in possession of* drugs at insomnia then you will be removed and banned until further notice." We didn't break this policy, per his wording. Furthermore, we never agreed to it, and if their policy exists, it certainly isn't available online -- the closest thing is Multiplay's Terms and Conditions, which, again, were unbroken. Incompetence aside, a company policy does not justify unlawful detainment by any means.  

Michael claimed the security staff "responded with how they felt they needed to as per the situation presented to them at the time." The "situation": nine quiet and introverted early twenty-somethings. We are not violent people. Most of us are IT professionals with college degrees.

With regards to our future at Insomnia, we would be allowed to return, but our accounts would be flagged, and "will be require to under go a more through (sic) search on the entrance to future events." In other words, we were always to be stigmatised, to be reminded of the time we were served an injustice, if we were ever to return. Unhappy with the tone of Michael's response, I went about drafting a second letter.

The second email we sent was a group letter detailing our thoughts on the incident, signed by the four of us who were unlawfully detained. Again, a useless response. Michael clung to the policy spiel, as if it were a catch-all that absolved the behaviour of his staff. Michael was *very* intent on deferring blame to the NEC, but the flaky defense made me realise whose fault it really was. Michael is Multiplay's lead event manager. Michael is directly responsible for everything that had happened. 

Resentment is a horrible feeling, and I don't think Michael Lambert understands the impact of his actions. The bans I could not care less about, and I'm uninterested in how he tries to justify the actions of his staff. What I do care about is the mental trauma coming from an injustice that was never put right. The incident has caused me to lose sleep at night, for several nights, several months after the event took place.

## Aftermath

With help from pro bono legal counsel, a pre-action letter was sent in September, and a letter of claim was sent in December. We sent these letters with recorded proof of delivery, to make sure they were being received and read. Something conveyed very clearly through these letters was that we were open to something being settled outside of court. Neither Michael Lambert, nor any legal representative, have made any effort to respond to our requests.

As for the (albeit unenforceable) NEC ban: my partner found that supposed NEC contact and shot off an email. He never received a reply.

It appears Multiplay have tried their best to distance themselves from this incident. The original thread and [almost](http://archive.is/FpjnI) all mention of the incident has since been purged from the Multiplay forums, because obviously it's bad for business. I foresaw something like this happening at the time, so I did at least back up my original posts [here](/misc/insomnia-1.txt) and [here](/misc/insomnia-2.txt) (NB: written at a stupid hour in the morning in the aftermath of a panic attack). 

Moving forward, I think there's something better I can seek than compensation from Multiplay. It's letting everyone know what Multiplay did, and how they tried to cover it up.

I want sponsors to see this, and I hope they consider sponsoring tournaments for other European events that deserve their attention (SweLAN, epic.LAN, etc).

I want potential visitors to understand they risk being abused by staff if they plan to attend an event hosted by Multiplay.

I want Multiplay to seriously reconsider how they approach these situations, and put more thought into who they are hiring as security personnel.

I want *an apology*.

## Downfall

I'm too old to be attending events like these anymore, I think. I'm definitely not as interested in video games as I used to be. 

But let's talk about Insomnia as an event: It's too big, and it's not really a LAN anymore. I'd suspect that GAME, Multiplay's co-parent, has been milking Insomnia for a few years now: The exhibition has slowly slid into being the front-and-centre for the event over the past few years, with the LAN turning into an afterthought. Long-time LAN goers have felt the burden of this.

The exhibition hall is as ordinary as any other over-commercialised event. If you have ever been to something like PAX or MCM, you've seen it all before: the "loot" crates full of Funko Pops and other bargain bin licensed merch, the meme t-shirt stands, the gamer hardware booths that don't sell anything, the same old boring things. It is *very* family oriented; a lot of people coming for the exhibition have purchased day tickets and have no idea that the LAN is a thing (at previous events, it was common for kids to wander into the LAN hall and attempt to log in to random machines). The queues for anything interesting are incredibly long, especially on the Saturdays. **TL;DR**: if you value your time, there is nothing here for you. 

The size is making it a greater target for thieves. Stickers won't protect against people stealing mice, keyboards and other peripherals, because security don't check those. Small, but expensive hardware such as a tablet, Nintendo Switch, etc is at risk too. There's a bunch of obvious ways to get around the stickers that I don't need to point out. Insomnia goers are having to deal with opportunists every year, and the attack surface will only get bigger as time goes on. Security will also flip-flop between ignoring rucksacks and aggressively checking wristbands, but I don't think I need to point out that security is a little inconsistent.

Attending is getting more and more expensive. Before the NEC, Insomnia was held at the Ricoh arena in Coventry. This location was brilliant because it was right next to a Tesco, so you had an easily accessible route to cheap food and drink. The NEC is nowhere near a supermarket. It's nowhere near anything. The Wetherspoons in the NEC has the most markup I've ever seen, and I live in London. Food and drink, alcohol especially, is marked up considerably despite the poor quality. Over the years, the rules on whether outside drink is allowed into various events or not has been arbitrary and unclear until the very last second, but with few exceptions the answer is "no". With no competition, Multiplay's food and drink caterers are running a monopoly.

It's just too big to be enjoyable. The appeal of size soon wears off, and we're not going to these things to meet a thousand people. Insomnia is GAME's cash cow, and it's time to stop pretending the organisers are heroes.

Obviously, it is the last time I'm going to attend. Multiplay can try their best to hide what they did, but I'm not letting them win.

Shame on you, Michael Lambert.
