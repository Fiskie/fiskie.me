Wow! I've been busy!

I kinda just stopped doing the status updates, huh? I'll keep doing them, just probably not on a weekly basis if I have nothing to report :3;;

* **backpack.tf**: A few bug fixes. php-pm server got pushed to production; the site is not using php-fpm anymore.
* **php-pm**: Published several PRs to PHP-PM, to add in-place reloads and a fixture test framework to improve code coverage. I think the project has a lot of potential, and I am also a customer, so I am eager to help improve it.
* **alt**: Learned how to document with Swagger/OpenAPI.

I've had to learn a lot about PHP-PM's internals, and by extension ReactPHP. Still learning about it!

There is definitely some sort of bug in PPM worker handling I want to look at. backpack.tf has died to it at least twice now, but only after running the server for a week, so debugging the cause is hard. Hopefully it's something I can reproduce later, as I'm slowly adding more unit tests to the project.
