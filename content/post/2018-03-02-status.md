## What have I done this week?

I began to write this entry earlier than usual because attended a wedding on the weekend, but then I forgot to publish it in time anyway.

I purchased a new domain and moved my site to it. I'm stuck with fiskie.me for a while since I've used it as an email alias for the past few years, so it's going to take a while before I update every account related to it.

Had a pretty terrible weekend. Dealt with some spontaneous performance problems, spending the Saturday diving into webgrind.

## What am I going to do next?

Half my weekend was spent on a wedding, so I haven't had much thought towards this. Maybe next week.
