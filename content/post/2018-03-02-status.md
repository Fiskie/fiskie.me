## What have I done this week?

I wrote this one earlier than usual because I'm busy attending a wedding this weekend.

I purchased a new domain and moved my site to it. I'm stuck with fiskie.me for a while since I've used it as an email alias for the past few years, so it's going to take a while before I update every account related to it.

Had a pretty terrible weekend. Dealt with some spontaneous performance problems, spending the Saturday diving into webgrind.

## What am I going to do next?
